This model can be used to run the simulations of Alexander et al. 2017 in matlab.

Note that compared to the aforementioned work, input parameters include the minimum and maximum values of growth rate (Gmin and Gmax) and sensitivity to competition (Lmin and Lmax) instead of the average and coefficient of variation of those traits as in the paper.
